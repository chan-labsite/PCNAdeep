Caliberate tracking using Deepcell-label Caliban software.
(ref: https://github.com/vanvalenlab/deepcell-label/)

Run docker image of the software through command:
'docker run -p 5900:5900 -v dclabel:/usr/src/app/desktop --privileged deepcell-label:latest'.
This virtually opens a server with password 'dclabel' on the computer.

To access the server, open MobaXTerm, initiate a VNC session and direct it to 127.0.0.1 through port 5900, enter the password above.
A ubuntu desktop should show up. To access command line, right click anywhere and find 'Applications > Terminal Emulators > XTerm'.
Navigate to /usr/src/app/desktop, find caliban.py there.

Run caliban through command 'python3 caliban.py [input file]

File transfer requires defined server ID. To check this, run 'docker ps -a'. Find 'CONTAINER ID' of our IMAGE 'deepcell-label:latest'.
The CONTAINER ID is the server ID.

To upload a file, run on host (our computer) command line:
'docker cp [file on host] [server ID]:[dir on server]'
To download, run on the host and in reverse:
'cp [server ID]:[file on server] [dir on host]'

/////// Tips for Caliban keyboard operations:

///// Navigation through Frames:
a or ← - Back one frame

d or → - Forward one frame

///// Edit Operations:
DeepCell Label's default setting allows operations to be carried out quickly and easily on existing segmentations. The actions that can modify cell labels and/or lineage information are:

click - click on a cell label to select it. Up to two labels can be selected at one time.

shift + click - trim stray pixels away from selected part of label

ctrl + click - flood selected part of label with a new, unused label

c - create: relabel selected label with a new, unused label

f - fill: select label, press "f", then follow prompt to fill a hole in the selected label

r - replace: relabel all instances of a selected cell label with a second selected cell label; replaces lineage data in a trk file

r - relabel: sequentially relabel all labels in frame, starting from 1, when no labels are selected (npz only)

p - parent: assign parent/daughter relationship to pair of selected labels in trk file

p - predict: predict zstack relationships in npz when no labels are selected

s - swap: swap labels and lineage information between two selected labels

x - delete: remove selected cell mask in frame

w - watershed: call watershed transform to split one cell label into two

esc - cancel operation
space bar - confirm operation
s - confirm operation in a single frame, when applicable

You can use esc to return back to a state where no labels are selected.

///////// In annotation (pixel editing) mode:

Keybinds in pixel editing mode are different from those in the label-editing mode.

Annotation mode focuses on using an adjustable brush to modify annotations on a pixel level, rather than using operations that apply to every instance of a label within a frame or set of frames. The brush tool will only make changes to the currently selected value. Ie, a brush set to edit label 5 will only add or erase "5" to the annotated image.

[ (left bracket) / ] (right bracket) - decrement/increment value that brush is applying

↓ ↑ - change size of brush tool

x - toggle eraser mode

n - change brush label to an unusued label, so that a new label can be created with a unique id. Can be used with conversion brush to overwrite existing label with unused label (follow conversion brush prompt).

p - color picker (click on a label to change the brush label to it)

r - turn on "conversion brush" setting, which changes brush behavior so that one label value is overwritten with another label value. No other labels are affected, and conversion brush will not draw on background. After turning on conversion brush, click on cell labels as prompted to set brush labels.

t - threshold to predict annotations based on brightness. After turning this on, click and drag to draw a bounding box around the cell you wish to threshold. Make sure to include some background in the bounding box for accurate threshold predictions. Whatever was thresholded as foreground within the bounding box will be added to the annotation as a new cell with unique label.

////// Viewing Options:
F11 - toggle fullscreen

-/= or ctrl + scroll wheel - change level of zoom

To pan in image: Hold down the spacebar while clicking and dragging image to pan. Alternatively, the keys home, page up, page down, and end can be used to jump across the screen. Holding the shift key while using these pan buttons will result in a smaller jump; holding the control key will snap to the edge of the image.

h - switch between highlighted mode and non-highlighted mode (highlight exists in whole-label mode and paint mode but is displayed differently; label-editing highlighting recolors solid label with red, paint mode highlighting adds white or red outline around label in image). Once highlight mode is on, use [ (left bracket) / ] (right bracket) to decrement/increment selected cell label number.

shift+h - switch between showing and hiding annotation masks in the pixel editor

z - switch between annotations and raw images (outside of pixel editor)

i - invert greyscale raw image (viewing raw image or in pixel editor)

k - apply sobel filter to raw image (viewing raw image or in pixel editor)

j - apply adaptive histogram equalization to raw image (viewing raw image or in pixel editor)

f - cycle between different annotations when no labels are selected (label-editing mode)

c - cycle between different channels when no labels are selected (label-editing mode)

shift + ↓ / ↑ - cycle between colormaps for viewing raw images (does not apply to pixel editor)

e - toggle annotation mode between paint mode and whole-label mode (when nothing else selected)

scroll wheel - change image or annotation maximum brightness

shift + scroll wheel - change image minimum brightness

////// To Save:
Once done, use the following key to save the changed file. The tool will also save the original file in the same folder. In npz mode, a new npz file will be saved with a version number. An npz can be saved as a trk file (select "t" in response to save prompt). This will bundle together the current channel and feature of the npz along with a generated lineage file, which will contain label and frame information and empty parent/daughter entries for each cell. The new trk file can then be edited in DeepCell Label's trk mode to add relationship information.

s - save
